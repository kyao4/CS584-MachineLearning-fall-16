# Legendary Pokemon Prediction

Members: Kai Yao

Dataset: [Pokemon](https://www.kaggle.com/abcsds/pokemon)

Goal: predict the legendary pokemon from attributes of each pokemon.


Description:
1. I am going to use the dataset that I downloaded from kaggle. This is a pokemon dataset with attributes like the HP, CP, attack speed, defense speed, type, generation of the pokemon. I decided to use these attributes to predict the Legendary for the pokemons. In general, the higher HP or CP a pokemon has, the higher its Legendary Degree is. We can use project to verify this assumption.

2.No, the problem is not posted on the website.

3.Because the pokemon go is so popluar recently, using a pokemon dataset is interesting.

4.Yes, https://www.kaggle.com/abcsds/pokemon

5.No

6.No

7.No


Collect data, pre-process it, load it to numpy/scipy matrices/arrays, print statistics about data size, visualize the class/target distribution using bar plots (classification target) or histograms (regression target), and print statistics and visualizations about the input features. You'll need to use numpy, scipy, and matplotlib libraries, and you'll need to create and submit a jupyter notebook. You have 2-3 weeks for this phase.
