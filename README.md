# Pokemon Generation Prediction

Members: Kai Yao, Zhaolei Fang

Dataset: [Pokemon](https://www.kaggle.com/abcsds/pokemon)

Goal: predict the generation from attributes of each pokenmon.


Collect data, pre-process it, load it to numpy/scipy matrices/arrays, print statistics about data size, visualize the class/target distribution using bar plots (classification target) or histograms (regression target), and print statistics and visualizations about the input features. You'll need to use numpy, scipy, and matplotlib libraries, and you'll need to create and submit a jupyter notebook. You have 2-3 weeks for this phase.
